# Per-Theorem Proof Status

Run `make verify` for the live audit. Below is the static state of
the development.

## Closed (machine-checked, zero admits, zero axioms used)

Every theorem in this table compiles with Coq 8.18 and reports
`Closed under the global context` under `Print Assumptions`.

| Theorem | File | Statement |
|---------|------|-----------|
| `erdos_rado_upper_bound` | `coq/ErdosRado.v` | `f(n, k) ≤ (k-1)^n · n! + 1` (Erdős–Rado 1960) |
| `erdos_rado_contrapositive` | `coq/ErdosRado_Greedy.v` | Contrapositive form of the upper bound |
| `erdos_rado_via_greedy` | `coq/ErdosRado_Greedy.v` | "Existence of sunflower" form |
| `erdos_rado_counted` | `coq/ErdosRado_Greedy.v` | Function-form `UpperBound n k (er_upper_bound n k)` |
| `lower_bound_trivial` | `coq/LowerBound.v` | `f(n, k) ≥ k` via the `k-1` disjoint blocks construction |
| `lower_bound_exponential` | `coq/ProductLowerBound.v` | `f(n, k) ≥ (k-1)^n + 1` via the product-family construction (Erdős–Rado 1960) |
| `prod_family_no_literal_sunflower` | `coq/ProductLowerBound.v` | The `(k-1)`-ary product family contains no `k`-sunflower (pigeonhole + canonical-representation induction) |
| `no_k_sunflower_short_family` | `coq/LowerBound.v` | A family of size `< k` contains no `k`-sunflower |
| `SubFamilySetEq_length` | `coq/LowerBound.v` | SetNoDup S + SubFamilySetEq S F → length S ≤ length F |
| `f_n_2_eq_2` | `coq/SmallCases.v` | `f(n, 2) = 2` for all `n ≥ 1` |
| `f_1_k_eq_k` | `coq/SmallCases.v` | `f(1, k) = k` for all `k ≥ 2` |
| `f_2_3_eq_7` | `coq/F23.v` | **`f(2, 3) = 7`** — the first nontrivial exact value for `k = 3` (`UpperBound 2 3 7` by a degree/matching double-counting argument; `~ UpperBound 2 3 6` by the two-disjoint-triangles family, checked reflectively) |
| `f_2_3_lower` | `coq/F23.v` | `LowerBound 2 3 6`: the two-triangles family of six 2-sets contains no 3-sunflower |
| `hall_abstract` | `coq/HallCore.v` | Hall's marriage theorem in abstract list form (Halmos–Vaughan induction): a `NoDup`-subset Hall condition yields a pairing saturating the left part |

| `koenig_theorem` | `coq/KoenigHall.v` | König's minimax theorem: maximum matching and minimum vertex cover exist with equal size in any simple bipartite graph (via the deficiency form of Hall) |
| `pigeonhole_family` | `coq/Pigeonhole.v` | Counting lemma: if every set in `F` meets `X` and `|F| > |X|·K` then some `x ∈ X` is in `> K` sets |
| `sunflower_lift` | `coq/Sunflower.v` | A `k`-sunflower in `{A\{x}}` lifts to `{A}` with adjusted core |
| `k_pairwise_disjoint_sunflower` | `coq/Sunflower.v` | `k` pairwise-disjoint nonempty sets are a `k`-sunflower with empty core |
| `max_disjoint_cover` | `coq/ErdosRado.v` | Greedy construction of a maximal-disjoint covering subfamily |

## Stated as a named axiom with literature citation (not used by any closed theorem)

| Statement | File | Citation |
|-----------|------|----------|
| `ALWZ20_spread_bound` | `coq/Spread.v` | Alweiss–Lovett–Wu–Zhang 2020 (STOC 2020), with FKNP19 / Ra20 / BCW21 refinements. Probabilistic argument; full proof not formalized here. |

## Stated in `coq/Conjecture.v` but **open since 1960**

| Statement | File | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **Sunflower Conjecture**: `∃ c : nat → nat, ∀ n k ≥ 2, UpperBound n k ((c k)^n + 1)` | `coq/Conjecture.v` `sunflower_conjecture` | **Open**. Erdős's $1000 prize remains unclaimed. |
| **k = 3 special case** | `coq/Conjecture.v` `sunflower_conjecture_k_3` | **Open**. The case Erdős singled out as containing "the whole difficulty". |

## Not formalized; proved in docs / verified computationally

| Statement | Doc | Verification |
|-----------|-----|--------------|
| `f(n, k) ≥ (k-1)^n + 1` (standard exponential lower bound) | `docs/problem.md` | **Now fully formalized** in `coq/ProductLowerBound.v` (`lower_bound_exponential`, closed under the global context) — see the "Closed" table above. The Rust brute-force checks in `rust/tests/small_cases.rs` remain as an independent computational cross-check. |
| `f(n, k) = o(n!)` (Kostochka 1997 refinement) | `docs/proof_strategies.md` | Not verified here. |
| `f(n, k) ≤ (C k log n)^n` (ALWZ–Rao–FKNP–BCW 2020+) | `coq/Spread.v` named axiom + `docs/spread_framework.md` | Not proved in Coq. |

## Axiom and admit audit

The `make verify` target runs `Print Assumptions` on every closed
theorem above. The expected output is:

```
Closed under the global context.
```

for every theorem in the "Closed" table. The current state of the
codebase satisfies this; the only `Axiom` in the entire Coq
development is `Spread.ALWZ20_spread_bound`, and it is *not used*
by any closed theorem (confirmed by `Print Assumptions`).

To verify directly:

```bash
echo 'From Sunflower Require Import ErdosRado ErdosRado_Greedy LowerBound ProductLowerBound SmallCases Pigeonhole.
Print Assumptions ErdosRado.erdos_rado_upper_bound.
Print Assumptions ErdosRado_Greedy.erdos_rado_via_greedy.
Print Assumptions LowerBound.lower_bound_trivial.
Print Assumptions ProductLowerBound.lower_bound_exponential.
Print Assumptions SmallCases.f_n_2_eq_2.
Print Assumptions SmallCases.f_1_k_eq_k.
Print Assumptions Pigeonhole.pigeonhole_family.' | coqtop -Q coq Sunflower 2>&1 | grep -B 1 "Closed\|Axioms"
```

The Rust companion in `rust/` is an *independent* computational
cross-check; see `rust/tests/small_cases.rs` for the 22 brute-force
assertions tying the formal bounds to concrete instances.
